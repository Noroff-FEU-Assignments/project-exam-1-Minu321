Through this project, I showcase the ability to fetch blog posts from an API and implement a functional contact form with validation. The website aims to provide insightful articles on various design and development topics while offering users the opportunity to engage through a seamless contact form.

## Description

Users can explore a variety of articles covering the latest trends, best practices, and valuable insights in the fields of design and development.
